# Apple Music's 100 Best Albums Helper
This tool helps you easily add all 100 albums that made the list to your Apple Music library.

## Step 1 - Log in
Log in using the Apple ID you want to add the albums to.

## Step 2 - Load the albums
This is the boring part. To get the full 100 buttons to render, you have to scroll from 100 to 1. I recommend using End, Page Down, or the down arrow in that order.

## Step 3 - Open the console and insert the code
1. Right-click on the page and click "Inspect".
2. Click the Console tab.
3. Paste the code at the prompt, usually indicated by `>`.
    - If you get a warning, type "allow paste" or follow the prompt's instructions.
    - Paste the code again.

## Step 4 - Wait, then check
In a best-case scenario, the servers will play nice, and all albums will be added. The console should output a success message.
If it failed, or not all albums made it through, refresh the page and start at Step 2.
